 attachment_large_object
=========================

Provides a storage option for attachments as PostgreSQL large objects.

For general information on the three classical ways to store file-like
content in a PostgreSQL DB, see `this wiki page
<https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/BinaryFilesInDB>`_.

Advantages
==========

Odoo supports two types of storage:

* in-database storage is a base64 encoded text column.
* file system storage (tree of directories so that it scales well on linked lists based file systems such as EXT4)

Advantages over the default in-database storage
-----------------------------------------------
- better RAM efficiency (the bigger each individual file is, the more
  this is true)
- possibility to dump easily the base without the large objects (very useful
  for bug reproduction)

Advantages over the file system storage
----------------------------------------
Nothing can beat the file system in terms of read/write
performance. That being said, large objects

- are transactional (fully ACID)
- work out of the box in multi-system setups (no need for NFS or
  similar file sharing tools)
- keep allowing easy, consistent backups of the whole system
