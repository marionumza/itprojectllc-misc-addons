			<li>allows to track the user working time</li>

			  <b>1</b><sup>st</sup> timer - it's time for <b><em>current subtask</em></b>. When approaching to 2 hours  boundary (the value can be changed in <em>Configuration &rarr; Subtask &rarr; Set completion time</em>), it changes color to orange and sounds a short signal. When the time is beyond the preset 2 hours limit, the timer is stopped, the color changes to red, it flashes and sounds a long beep. If you click on the timer, it works as a pause.
			</li>
			<li>
			  <b>2</b><sup>nd</sup> timer - it's general time for <b><em>current task</em></b> (only the time of current user is taken into account and summed). Once the "Initially planned hours" value is exceeded (all the time records related to the task are teaken into account), it changes color to yellow. When "Initially planned hours" exceeds 100% (set it in Configuration), it changes color to red. Clicking on the timer opens the current task.

			  <b>3</b><sup>rd</sup> timer - it's general time for <b><em>current day</em></b>. If the time reaches 5 hours (set it in <em>Configuration &rarr; Day &rarr; Set normal time</em>), it changes color to yellow and if it reaches 6 hours (set it in <em>Configuration &rarr; Day &rarr; Set good time</em>), it changes color to green. Clicking on the timer opens a page with the current day logs.

			  <b>4</b><sup>th</sup> timer - it's general time for <b><em>current week</em></b>. When reaching 30 hours (set it in <em>Configuration &rarr; Week &rarr; Set normal time</em>), it changes color to green and sounds a beautiful melody. When reaching 40 hours (set it in <em>Configuration &rarr; Week &rarr; Set good time</em>), it changes color to blue and sounds a long beautiful melody.

              If there are subtasks that contain time records on previous days, they will be unavailable for user. Also user will be able to start the timer on own subtasks only (the subtask owner is displayed in the "Done by" column).
